I am professor of economics at the University of Southampton and research fellow at the IHS, Vienna, in the Behavioral Economics group. My research interests include experimental methods in economics, field experiments in labor, education economics and the economics of charitable giving. I also conduct laboratory experiments to investigate human biases in decision making.
