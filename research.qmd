I am mainly working on behavioral and experimental economics. I currently combine lab-experimental methods with large scale field experiments.

## Work in progress


- *Narratives to Sustainable Agriculture*: Evidence from Madagascars Vanilla Farmers with Marcela Ibanez and Viviana Uruena. Funded by Volkswagenfoundation

- *Substitution between Charities* Evidence from several experiments on how people substitute between charities and whether multiple charitable appeals create crowding in or crowding out of charitable contributions. With David Reinstein (Maastricht)

- *Radicalism and Social Cohesion*: Evidence from Greece here we observe how group cooperation can break down when the collaborative effort
has positive externalities on a commonly unloved state—in our case the German state from the viewpoint of Greek students. 450 observations
of Greek students. Joint with Alexia Katsanidou (Cologne) and Roula Nezi (Surrey)

- *Behavioral Insights into Pension Savings*: Surveys and Lab-in-the-field experiments in Bogota, Colombia. Survey on financial issues, well-being
and cognitive ability (1200 subjects). Matched with 600 answers from a lab-in-the-field experiment on higher order risk preferences. Joint with
Marcela Ibanez (Gottingen) and Sebastian Schneider (MPI Bonn).

- *Household Bargaining over Prosocial Decisions: Evidence from Egypt.*
Representative sample of Cairo population of married women. 600 observations of household survey data and bargaining experiments over
